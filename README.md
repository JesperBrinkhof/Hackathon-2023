# Bellingcat Hackathon-2023
Team name: UVA trash(wo)men

Members: Meg, Nora, Jesper

Originally this project aimed to shine a light on landfill management across the world using OSINT. This brought us to waste management in the Gaza Strip where we eventually focused on highlighting waste mismanagement through satellite fire analysis.

The biggest roadbump we faced was making sense of the multiple factors contributing to this issue throughout history. This is why we will continue to work on this project (as part of our Open Source Investigations UVA course) to build a comprehensive picture of the waste management situation in the Gaza Strip, including stakeholders, challenges, and solutions.
